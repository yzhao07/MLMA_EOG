Return the stroke probability map for the continuous CNN model.

## input:   
data(type:numpy array)(shape:time * 2)  
model(sklearn model or pytorch model)  
flatten(type: bool)(whether to flatten the input as 200 or use 100*2 as the model input)  
 
## output:   
probanility_map(shape:(number of segments, 12) = ((1+2+4+8+3+6+9), 12)) = (33, 12))
split_list = [1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 9]
